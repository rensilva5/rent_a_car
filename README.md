This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

# Create folder and open it in Visual Studio Code (Car rental service)

# Create a next.js project using npm car_portfolio (npx create-next--app@latest)

# Take some defaults

# Have RapidAPI setup and ready to fecth.

Then, run the development server:

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

# or

pnpm dev

# or

bun dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
